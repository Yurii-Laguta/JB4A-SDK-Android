You can enable analytics by setting the appropriate parameter in the ETPushConfig.Builder(). Before implementing this call, ensure you update your [ETPushConfig.Builder()]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/implement-sdk-google.html) as described in step 6. Set the **enableAnalytics** parameter to **true** to implement Analytics in your mobile app. Set the **setWamaEnabled** parameter to **true** to implement [Web and Mobile Analytics](https://help.exacttarget.com/en/documentation/web_and_mobile_analytics/){:target="_blank"} in your mobile app.
